Apply ALL of the following changes to the existing project.
This is a final MVP polish pass.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT redesign the UI
- Keep existing layout and styling wherever possible
- Focus on functionality, wiring, and correctness
- Frontend-only MVP is fine
- Use simple JavaScript & local state if needed

==================================================
1) BRAND & LOGO
==================================================

- Change brand name everywhere from any old name to: Trustive
- Replace logo with:
  Green square background + white 5-point star (clean, centered)
- Use this logo consistently in:
  navbar
  footer
  favicon (if exists)
  pages where logo is shown

==================================================
2) AUTH PROFILE (TOP RIGHT)
==================================================

- Add a small user profile icon/avatar at the top right
- Default profile picture should appear beside the Logout button
- This profile icon represents the reviewer user
- Clicking it can open a simple dropdown (optional MVP):
  - My Profile
  - Logout

(No backend auth needed; simulated auth is fine)

==================================================
3) COACH PROFILE CREATION
==================================================

- Add a button: "Create Coach Profile"
- This button is visible for coaches
- Leads to a page where coaches can submit their profile

PROFILE FORM FIELDS:
- Full name
- Category
- Country
- City / Address (IMPORTANT)
- Instagram
- Website (optional)

RULE:
- Website button/link should ONLY appear on coach profile page
  IF the coach has added a website.
- If no website provided, hide website button completely.

==================================================
4) REVIEWS — FIX ALL ISSUES
==================================================

REVIEW ISSUES TO FIX:
- Submitted reviews are NOT showing → FIX this
- Reviews should render immediately after submission
- Reviews must be tied to the correct coach profile

REVIEW FORM MUST INCLUDE:
- Star rating (clickable stars ONLY, no select, no checkmark)
- Review title
- Review text
- Address / City of service (IMPORTANT)
- Checkbox: “I paid for this service”
- Optional anonymous toggle

STAR RATING FIX:
- REMOVE any checkmark or select/dropdown
- Use 5 clickable stars only
- Store selected rating in JS properly

REVIEW COUNT FIX:
- Review number shown must ALWAYS equal
  the number of reviews actually displayed
- No fake or hardcoded numbers

==================================================
5) CLAIM PROFILE PAGE
==================================================

- Create a page: /claim-profile
- Clicking "Claim this profile" should navigate here

FORM FIELDS:
- Coach name
- Email
- Message
- Instruction text:
  "Please contact us from your official Instagram or professional email."

(Manual verification is fine for MVP)

==================================================
6) COACH DASHBOARD (FUNCTIONAL MVP)
==================================================

Create a page: /manage-profile

This page allows a coach (simulated auth is fine) to:
- View their professional profile
- Edit:
  name
  bio
  website
- View all reviews on their profile
- Reply to reviews (text replies shown under reviews)

Replies should display clearly as:
"Response from professional"

No backend needed — local state is acceptable.

==================================================
7) STATIC PAGES (MUST WORK)
==================================================

ABOUT US PAGE (/about):
Use this content (exact text allowed):
---
Trustive is a trust and review platform built to help people make better decisions before paying for services.

We provide a transparent space where users can read real experiences related to paid services, understand patterns, and choose with confidence. Trustive focuses on fairness, clarity, and moderation — not promotion or judgment.

Our goal is simple:

---

TRUST & SAFETY PAGE (/trust-safety):

CONTACT PAGE (/contact):
Show clearly:

TRUST IN REVIEWS PAGE (/trust-in-reviews):

==================================================
8) FOOTER CLEANUP (FINAL)
==================================================

FOOTER MUST:
- NOT include Login
- NOT include For Coaches section
- NOT include auth links

FINAL FOOTER LINKS ONLY:
- About Us → /about
- Trust & Safety → /trust-safety
- Trust in Reviews → /trust-in-reviews
- Contact → /contact

Footer should be informational only.

==================================================
9) GENERAL QUALITY FIXES
==================================================

- All buttons must be clickable and lead somewhere meaningful
- No dead links
- No placeholder numbers
- Search must still work
- Existing SEO profile pages must remain intact

==================================================
FINAL GOAL
==================================================

After this update:
- Reviews work correctly
- Counts are accurate
- Profiles feel real
- Footer is clean
- Branding is consistent
- Trustive feels like a real, usable MVP

This is the final MVP polish pass.
