Modify the existing FitTrust project.
DO NOT redesign the UI. DO NOT change styling unnecessarily.
Only fix functionality and navigation.

========================
ISSUE 1 + 2: LOGIN & SIGNUP
========================

Fix the broken Login button and add a Signup option.

NAVBAR CHANGES:
- Remove current broken Login behavior
- Add two buttons in navbar:
  1) Log in
  2) Sign up

Create pages:
- /login
- /signup

LOGIN PAGE (/login):
- Email input
- Password input
- Login button
- Text link: "Create an account" → /signup

On submit:
- Prevent page reload
- console.log email + password
- Simulate login using:
  localStorage.setItem("isLoggedIn", "true")
- Redirect to homepage

SIGNUP PAGE (/signup):
- Name, Email, Password inputs
- Sign up button
- Text link: "Already have an account?" → /login

On submit:
- console.log form data
- localStorage.setItem("isLoggedIn", "true")
- Redirect to homepage

AUTH STATE:
- If isLoggedIn === true:
  - Hide Login & Signup buttons
  - Show Logout button
- Logout clears localStorage and redirects home

========================
ISSUE 3: FOR COACHES PAGE
========================

Create a page /for-coaches

Purpose:
Display all coach profile data in one place (admin-style view).

Page content:
- Heading: "For Coaches"
- List all existing coach profiles (name, category, rating, link)
- Each item links to its coach profile page (/coach/slug)

This page is informational only (no auth required for MVP).

The main "For Coaches" navbar button should link here.

========================
ISSUE 4: SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
========================

Make the homepage search input functional.

Behavior:
- When user types a name and clicks Search:
  - Redirect to /search?q=SEARCH_TERM

Create SEARCH RESULTS page (/search):
- Read query parameter from URL
- Display heading:
  "Search results for: {query}"
- Filter coach list by name (case-insensitive)
- Display matching coach cards
- Each result links to coach profile page
- If no result:
  Show "No coaches found"

========================
ISSUE 5: REMOVE UNUSED NAV ITEMS
========================

Remove these buttons from the top navbar completely:
- Blog
- Categories
- Duplicate For Coaches link if exists

Final navbar buttons should be:
- Logo (home)
- For Coaches
- Log in / Sign up (or Logout if logged in)

========================
IMPORTANT RULES:
- Keep existing SEO coach pages intact
- Keep current design language
- Use simple JavaScript
- Hardcoded data is fine
- No backend
- No database
- Beginner-friendly code

========================
FINAL GOAL:
A working MVP where:
- Login works (simulated)
- Signup exists
- Search works
- For Coaches page works
- Navigation is clean
