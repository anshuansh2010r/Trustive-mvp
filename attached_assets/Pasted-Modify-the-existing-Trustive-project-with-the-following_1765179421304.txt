Modify the existing Trustive project with the following changes.

THIS IS A FINAL MVP STABILIZATION + AUTH + CLAIM UPDATE.  
Do NOT redesign the UI.  
Do NOT remove existing working pages (profiles, reviews, footer, trust pages).  
Only extend and fix logic.

==================================================
1) USER TYPES & LOGIN MODALITY
==================================================

Goal: Separate USERS and COACHES cleanly.

1.1 Login Type Selection:
- On the login page, add two options:
  - "Login as User"
  - "Login as Coach"
- This can be radio buttons, tabs, or a dropdown.
- Based on selection:
  - "Login as User" → logs into user account and shows the EXISTING user experience (user dashboard minimal).
  - "Login as Coach" → logs into a coach account and opens the COACH DASHBOARD.

1.2 Separate Auth Data:
Implement separate storage for:
- Users
- Coaches

Use either:
- a simple database if already present, OR
- localStorage as a fallback

For example:
- localStorage["trustive_users"] = JSON array of user accounts
- localStorage["trustive_coaches"] = JSON array of coach accounts

Each user account should at least store:
- id
- name
- email
- password (NOT secure, just hashed or plain for MVP)
- profileImage (optional URL/base64)

Each coach account should at least store:
- id
- name
- email
- password
- profileImage
- linkedCoachProfileId (link to coach profile in the main coach list)

1.3 Fix Login/Signup Malfunction:
- Currently login/signup only work for a single user. Fix this so:
  - Multiple users can sign up and log in.
  - Multiple coaches can sign up and log in.
- Sign up should:
  - Add a new user/coach entry to the correct array in storage.
- Login should:
  - Check credentials against the correct list (users vs coaches).
  - Set a "currentUser" or "currentCoach" object in localStorage like:
    - localStorage["trustive_current_user"]
    - localStorage["trustive_current_coach"]


==================================================
2) PROFILE PICTURES (USERS & COACHES)
==================================================

2.1 User Profile Picture:
- On user signup OR in user dashboard, add an option to upload a profile picture.
- Store this as:
  - a URL (if using an upload service) OR
  - base64 string inside user account object (for MVP).
- In the USER dashboard, show:
  - user name
  - user profile picture
  (Only these two are required in user dashboard for now.)

2.2 Coach Profile Picture:
- When publishing a coach profile or claiming a profile, add an option to upload a profile picture for the coach (headshot or brand logo).
- This picture should show:
  - On the coach profile page
  - In the coach dashboard

2.3 Top-right Avatar:
- At the top right (where Logout is), show a small circular avatar:
  - For logged-in users: their profile picture
  - For logged-in coaches: their profile picture
- If no picture is set, show a generic default avatar icon.


==================================================
3) COACH PROFILE PUBLISHING & CLAIMING
==================================================

3.1 "Publish as a Coach" Button:
- Add a button in the top navbar: "Publish as a Coach"
- This should lead to the existing "Create/Publish Coach Profile" page.

3.2 Password & Picture on Publishing:
- When publishing a NEW coach profile (not claiming), the form must include:
  - Password (for coach login later)
  - Profile picture upload
- On submit:
  - Create both:
    - a COACH PROFILE entry (in the existing coaches list/system)
    - a COACH ACCOUNT in the coach auth storage (trustive_coaches) with:
      - linkedCoachProfileId
      - email
      - password
      - profileImage, etc.

3.3 Claim ≠ Instant Control:
Claiming a profile must NOT give instant control.

Update claim logic to:

- Each coach profile must have:
  - claimed: true/false
  - claim_status: "unclaimed" | "pending" | "claimed"
  - owner_user_id or owner_coach_id (ID from coach accounts list)

- When someone submits the "Claim this profile" form:
  - Set claim_status = "pending"
  - Do NOT set claimed = true yet
  - Do NOT assign owner_user_id yet
  - Show a confirmation message like:
    "Your claim request has been submitted and is pending review."

- Only after manual approval (for now you can simulate this via developer/admin UI or by toggling values in code/temp admin page):
  - Set claim_status = "claimed"
  - Set claimed = true
  - Set owner_coach_id to the correct coach account
  - Only then allow editing of profile fields.

3.4 Password on Claim:
- When a claim is approved, allow the coach to set a password if they don’t already have one.
- This password is then required to:
  - log in as coach
  - access coach dashboard for that profile.

3.5 Single Owner Rule (One Owner Per Profile):
- Once a coach profile is claimed (claim_status = "claimed", claimed = true):
  - Additional claim requests should go into a "queue" (e.g. an array or list for admins to review).
  - But DO NOT override the existing owner automatically.
- Only admin/dev (you) should decide if ownership changes.


==================================================
4) COACH DASHBOARD & EDIT PERMISSIONS
==================================================

4.1 Coach Dashboard Access:
- When user logs in as a coach:
  - Show the COACH DASHBOARD (not user dashboard).
  - Load the coach data from trustive_coaches and the linked coach profile from the main profiles list.

4.2 Edit Permissions:
- Only the coach who owns the profile should be able to:
  - edit name, bio, website, profile picture, etc.
- Implement checks like:
  - If logged-in coach.id === coachProfile.owner_coach_id → show edit buttons.
  - Else → hide edit buttons.

4.3 Reply to Reviews:
- In coach dashboard, allow owner coach to reply to reviews as before.
- Responses should show under the review with clear label:
  "Response from professional".

4.4 Website Visibility Rule:
- On coach profile:
  - ONLY show "Website" button/link IF a website was actually provided.
  - If website field is empty/null → hide the button entirely.


==================================================
5) DEVELOPER-ONLY REMOVE PROFILE FEATURE
==================================================

Add a simple dev-only "Remove Profile" button for unverified or spammy coaches.

- On coach profile page OR in a dev-only admin page:
  - Add a button: "Remove Profile (Dev Only)"
- When clicked:
  - Prompt for a password.
  - Only proceed if password == "removeit69"
  - If correct:
    - Remove the coach profile from the main profiles list.
    - Optionally remove the associated coach auth account.
  - If incorrect:
    - Show "Invalid developer password."

This is a simple safety tool for cleanup during MVP.


==================================================
6) REVIEW SYSTEM STABILITY & RATE LIMIT
==================================================

6.1 Review Submission Working:
- Ensure that when a user submits a review:
  - It is properly attached to the correct coach profile.
  - It shows up immediately in the Reviews section of that profile.
  - The review count at the top matches the number of reviews in the list (no fake numbers, no mismatch).

6.2 Rate Limiting:
- Implement a basic frontend-only rate limit:
  - The same user (same logged-in user or same browser if not logged in) should NOT be able to submit more than 5 reviews within 1 minute.
- Simple approach:
  - Track timestamps of last reviews in localStorage or in-memory.
  - If user tries to submit >5 reviews in 60 seconds, show:
    "You are submitting too many reviews. Please wait a moment."


==================================================
7) GENERAL STABILITY & NON-BREAKING BEHAVIOR
==================================================

- Keep all existing static pages as they are:
  - About Us
  - Trust & Safety
  - Trust in Reviews
  - Contact
- Keep current SEO profile URLs intact.
- Do NOT delete or rename main routes.
- Ensure:
  - Login and signup work for multiple accounts, not just one.
  - User login → minimal user dashboard (name + picture).
  - Coach login → coach dashboard with profile management and reply to reviews.
- Do NOT add advanced security like OTP or external identity verification.
- Comments in code should explain:
  - Where user data is stored
  - Where coach data is stored
  - Where claim status is set/updated

FINAL GOAL:
After these changes, Trustive should have:
- Working multi-user auth (users + coaches separated)
- Safe, non-instant profile claiming
- Clear ownership rules (one owner per profile)
- Usable dashboards for users and coaches
- Profile pictures for both roles
- Rate-limited reviews
- Stable, demo-ready MVP behavior.
